# Python Automation Toolkit

## Overview

This repository is inspired by the "Automating Real-World Tasks with Python" course, part of the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate. The purpose of this project is to provide a collection of Python scripts that automate common everyday tasks. The scripts use the `requests` module for tasks like posting text files and images to a URL, creating PDF files, and sending emails.

## Features

- **File Uploader**: Upload text files and images to a specified URL using the `requests` module.
  
- **PDF Generator**: Create PDF files from text content using Python.

- **Email Sender**: Send emails programmatically using Python, with customizable content and attachments.
